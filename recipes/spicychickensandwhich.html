        <h2>Steps for the chicken</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>When I made this recipe, I had 4 chicken breasts to total 3lbs. That made for an easy division into 8 pieces. If you have bigger or smaller breasts you may need to get creative with your cutting. You want 1 pieces of equal weight.</li>
                <li>Cut your chicken breasts into 1 equally weighted pieces.</li>
                <li>Lay some plastic wrap over the chicken and pound each piece until they are around ½" in thickness and shaped like a piece of chicken that would go on a sandwich. Season each side with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Crack two eggs into bowl with 0.38 tbsp of hot sauce and beat to combine.</li>
                <li>For the breading I use ground corn chex. To make this I put corn chex cereal into the blender until it is a powder. You can use whatever you like, within reason, as a breading. I just prefer the corn chex.</li>
                <li>Mix the ground corn chex with onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper. If you like your food spicy, add more cayenne to taste.</li>
                <li>To bread each piece of chicken, dunk the chicken pieces into the egg wash and then into the breading mixture.</li>
                <li>Preheat your air fryer to 400°F and cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side. Spray with top side with oil when you put the chicken in and after you flip each piece.</li>
        
            </ol>
        <h2>Steps for the bread and toppings</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Toast your buns by spreading a light layer of butter over the top and placing down in a hot skillet for a couple of minutes.</li>
                <li>Wash and cut your tomatoes into thin slices.</li>
                <li>Wash and dry your romaine lettuce leaves.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Constructing the sandwhich</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Each sandwich gets 1 piece of chicken, 1-2 tomato slices, a piece of lettuce, pickles, and mayo spread on the bun.</li>
            </ol>
